## Working on a Metroidvania
---
I've begun working on a new game! 

There isn't a lot to show now, just a doodled player sprite and stolen tilemap, but I've got collision *mostly* working, and the basic movement slapped together in code. 

The game's being made in [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/), an ECS engine made in Rust!



I'll upload occasional updates, 'til then just stew in the knowledge that this game will be about *Alchemy*.

**Edit: The project is on hold until I have the time to work on it.**
