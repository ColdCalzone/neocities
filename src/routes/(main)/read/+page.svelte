                <p>I got recommended this book by a friend when I asked about resources for making a compiler. Literally could not have asked for a better resource lmao. I must admit, though, that I wasn't able to fully follow the book, because I was using Rust, and found it difficult translating from Java. (It should be noted I was much worse at Rust at the time, though it would've been helpful to make another implementation first.)</p>

                <p>My history with Homestuck is long, to say the least. Perhaps responsible for my interest in computer science being what it is today, and yet, paradoxically, my interest in Homestuck stems in my interest in programming (and Undertale...).</p>
                <p>In recent times I've taken a much more active interest in Homestuck, to say the least. I've also become involved in an <a href="https://alternativefunction.neocities.org">MSPFA</a> -- or "MS Paint Fan Adventure", based on the old title of Homestuck's website, mspaintadventures -- with several other people.</p>
                <p>It starts slow, but it's worth it. About 8000 pages long.</p>

                Despite what this page may imply, *I don't read much*, and if I wanted to read a book,
                I'd just read it. Maybe if I start a real good book, I'll put it here before finishing it.
