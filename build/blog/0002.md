## ACDSstuck
---
I've yet to actually make a post about this, and with the recent re-work of my site, I figure I might as well mention it:

I've been working on a [Homestuck](https://homestuck.com) fan comic called [ACDSstuck](https://acdsstuck.neocities.org)!

I've done most of the design of the site, and wrote the javascript for the comic (based on previous work for [Shopfalls](https://deep-freezer.neocities.org/shopstuck/) and [Shopstuck](https://other-space.neocities.org/start.html)). *Please* check it out, it's only 89 pages at the time of writing but it's actively being worked on.

(Also, if you intend on actually reading Homestuck, please use [this instead](https://413.gay). It restores the comic to how it *should* be.)
