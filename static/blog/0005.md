## Fixing my computer's workflow
---
An unexpected sequel!

I've suddenly and quickly slid back into Linux. It started small, with [No Boilerplate](https://www.youtube.com/c/noboilerplate) videos in the background while I procrastinated writing an essay (the major one sparking this change being [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFkGNe4oaKk)). Then I moved from [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to [Helix](https://helix-editor.com/) -- a modal editor, and I want you to keep in mind I've never used [Vim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)) or [Emacs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs) or any kind of modal editor before, and at this point I was still on Windows! Soon using [Zellij](https://zellij.dev/) caught my eye -- yet it's incompatible with Windows, unsurprisingly. How often do you get a "[terminal multiplexer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_multiplexer) using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) fanatic with a modal editor" on *Windows*?

I could've given up there, stuck with just Helix. It was already much better feeling -- I quite like the window splitting, and modal editing came *very* naturally -- but no. I couldn't. Maybe [WSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux)? Nah, too cumbersome. If I'm gonna use Linux I'm gonna go all in. And when I say all in, I mean **all in**.

I'll cut to the chase, though that's cutting a lot. I'm on [NixOS](https://nixos.org/) now. Again, [inspired by a No Boilerplate video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwfKlX3rA6E); I'm still learning what the hell is going on with Nix, though I've got the basics down. I'm set up with Zellj and Helix, as I said before, a terminal file manager called [Yazi](https://yazi-rs.github.io/), which is a godsend since Helix doesn't have a file tree built in, a replacement for ls called [Eza](https://eza.rocks/), terminal emulator called [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org/), which is *so nice*, and a new shell called [Fish](https://fishshell.com/) -- I was hesitant to do this one, but I learned about the scripting abilities and immediately made up my mind. Fuck aliases.

All this together has overhauled how I write code. As a matter of fact, I'm writing this in my new setup.

<div style="text-align: center; margin: 0;"> <i>(I had to add the functionality to put images in these posts for this LMAO. Now I need to add a way to click it to get the full resolution)</i> </div>

But that's not all! With Fish's scripting, I've made a function to spawn a new tab with this setup:

<div style="text-align: center; margin: 0;"> <i>(I wish this was an embedded code block, but the image will have to do.)</i> </div>

But! That's! Not! All!

With this setup I also have [GitUI](https://github.com/extrawurst/gitui), which lets me cope by feeling like I'm working with `git` in the terminal while still having an actually useable interface. Also the example gif looks like an fgc combo tutorial and it's funny.

This basically eliminates one of my major reasons for using VS Code: the Git integration. I simultaneously feel like a fuckin stereotype and an actually accomplished programmer. Let's hope I don't start flexing this on Reddit, which would require me to use my Reddit account (and is therefore indicative of a much, much worse change).

Happy hacking!
