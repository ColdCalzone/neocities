                        <p>I got recommended this book by a friend when I asked about resources for making a compiler. Literally could not have asked for a better resource lmao. I must admit, though, that I wasn't able to fully follow the book, because I was using Rust, and found it difficult translating from Java. (It should be noted I was much worse at Rust at the time, though it would've been helpful to make another implementation first.)</p>
