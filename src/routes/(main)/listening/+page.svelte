    <h1>Listening</h1>
    <p>I decided to share some of the music I'm listening to, in part since the design of this page struck me at 1 AM like a freight train and in part because, it'd be fun?</p>
    <p><b>DISCLAIMER:</b> I like <i>phonk</i>. This has a good chance of changing with what regard you hold my opinions on music. And that's entirely fair.</p>

        <p>This one got me through the latter half of senior year. I love just about everything in this track, from the growly and noisy synth to the knife foley, but <i>god</i> the violin at ~0:38 hits.</p>

        <i>CW: Gore</i>
        <p>Though I've yet to fully penetrate the meaning of this one, I appreciate the running theme of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrsr_-QXCv4">unhealthy relationships between art and the artist</a>. Perhaps there's something to be said about <i>pouring your heart out</i> with this one.</p>

        <p>Another I haven't quite breached the themes of, other than probably being about the constant stream of information available via the internet?<br><br>I've linked the official English cover in the YouTube slot, I just really like it.</p>

        <p>I don't really have anything to say about this one. It kinda just bangs.</p>

        <p>I'd put some analysis here but the themes of this song are so clear I literally could not convey it more efficiently than the song itself. Just listen to it.</p>

        <p>Holy shit nothing notified me about this song. Probably because I didn't like their last song <i>at all</i> so the ~algorithm~ didn't bother, but this is so good.</p>

        <p>Here's the first instance of phonk in this page, which regretably will repeat. Though, the definition of "phonk" is a little hazy, for both me and probably these producers. Maybe I should call it "low effort electronic"?</p>

        <p>This one begins a disappointing trend, though perhaps a predictable one. You can see <b>MADE IN HEAVEN</b> has some Arknights character on the cover... well this one's AI. In fact, there's reason to believe the songs are too. There's reason to believe almost every phonk song is.</p>

      <ListeningBox cover="https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e020e692c92147066225f62c7af" link_a="https://open.spotify.com/track/6z9UVyzP5cGSsVmsOhG28F" text_a="KoruSe + MITUJURO - NEW WAY (Spotify)" link_b="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0FefJqyUSs" text_b="(YouTube)">
        <p>Yet again, AI generated. I feel weird even putting these up here, in a sense platforming AI generated content. On the other hand, the music is good, and it's probable these particular creators are actually authentic producers (and just defer to AI or theft for covers. hm.)</p>

        <p>Technically, this isn't phonk; it lacks the hallmark cowbells. However, it's similar. You'll notice there's no real analysis for these ones. That's because Phonk isn't really ripe for inspection. It's just meant to sound good. I don't think the music is AI generated, so there's that at least.</p>
