## Fixing my site's workflow
---
Well, that's done now.

This site was initially developed in pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a "macro" system I devised myself that just required one build step. I wrote that step with [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), which [Neocities itself uses for CLI uploading](https://neocities.org/cli), and it also handled the old iteration of this blog, with [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) rendering programmed by myself as well. This system was suitable. It was natural.

Recently I've been less content with this though. I've felt limited by it. Especially in the styling department, which was a headache to think about. And in the testing department, since the live server extension I use wouldn't default to the `out/` folder. And-- I could go on.

I've also recently been doing web development work for my school. In doing this I though it was natural to use an _actual_ framework instead of cobbling raw HTML together, so I could prototype faster. I decided to use [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), which is both a [reactive framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_programming) (something I've been interested in, purely theoretically, for some time) and piss easy to use. And, oh hey, it made styling reused components feel natural. Fascinating.

That prototype was such a joy to make I decided to do the spring cleaning I'd been thinking about for a while. So I made a branch on [the Github repo for this site](https://github.com/coldcalzone/neocities), deleted everything, and made a new [Sveltekit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) project. Svelte is actually meant to run on proper servers and do serverside rendering with a bunch of neat bells and whistles to-- I don't care about any of that. Well, I do actually, since I need that for the work I'm doing for my school, but I just need it to generate [static site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page) here. It's not like Neocities lets you upload server software. Nor would I want to, that's too much overhead.

I'll skip my normal meandering prose, since I've already nearly filled my screen in VS Code. The main struggles of this were in re-implementing sloppily designed dynamic components, i.e. [Shopfalls](/shopfalls/prelude) and the drawing feature (it persists through pages now, by the way). Shopfalls in particular is still a little _ehhh_ since the rendering and fetching aren't as coupled as they really should be and it desyncs weirdly. Also the video is totally broken LMAO.

Regardless, with this update has come two new pages: 
* [The Homestuck Portal](/homestuck/), which will catalogue my essays and musings. Perhaps I'll add something of a wiki to give everything the individual focus it needs. Who knows?
* [The Comments page](/comments), which I stole from [charbomber](https://charbomber.neocities.org/), my neighbor on the ACDS webring!
